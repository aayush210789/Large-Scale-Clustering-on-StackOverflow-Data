# Large-Scale-Clustering-on-StackOverflow-Data

# Objective

The main objective of the project is to implement K-means Clustering algorithm using Spark on HDFS distributed cluster. The algorithm is implemented in Python. Following are the goals achieved through clustering:

-Clustering is implemented on User base data to group similar users on the basis of their skills. Their skills are quantified taking appropriate features.

-Also, K-means algorithm is used to make homogeneous clusters of Posts on the basis of their relevance which is determined by taking suitable features.

-The results are discussed, justified and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on output.

-Lastly, Mlib library is used to obtain the outputs for both the cases and the results are compared.
